## Update your fork

Szenario: You have forked a repository and did some changes. In the meantime also the original developer did some updates in his repository. You want to takeover these.

Here we use a rebase, so our commits are then added to the new (updated) base.

Quelle: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7244321/how-do-i-update-or-sync-a-forked-repository-on-github](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7244321/how-do-i-update-or-sync-a-forked-repository-on-github)

Add the remote, call it "upstream":
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/whoever/whatever.git
```
Fetch all the branches of that remote into remote-tracking branches
```bash
git fetch upstream
```
Make sure that you're on your main branch:
```bash
git checkout main
```
Rewrite your main branch so that any commits of yours that
aren't already in upstream/main are replayed on top of that
other branch:
```bash
git rebase upstream/main
```
If you don't want to rewrite the history of your master branch, (for example because other people may have cloned it) then you should replace the last command with `git merge upstream/master`. However, for making further pull requests that are as clean as possible, it's probably better to rebase.

---
If you've rebased your branch onto upstream/main you may need to force the push in order to push it to your own forked repository on GitHub. You'd do that with:
```bash
git push -f origin main
```
You only need to use the `-f` the first time after you've rebased.

## Git –assume-unchanged

When installing apps locally some files have data which is unique to your install path or domain. For example I installed our app at EasyRx locally and the yaml setting for the domain used for cookies was tracked by git. I changed the value in my local install but then it showed up as a change in git which I definitely don’t want to commit.

There is a temporary option.
```bash
git update-index --assume-unchanged /path/to/file.yml
```
Setting `--assume-unchanged` to the file will effectively hide those changes.

However, be aware, if you `git add` the specific file it will add it to the files staged for commit. If you just do a blanket `git commit -a` it won’t add the file. Of course you need to remember that it’s set that way!

---
Let’s go over a quick example of using the command. Changes have been made to a few files in my working directory:
```bash
$ git status
# On branch master
#
# Changed but not updated:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#
#	modified:   README.textile
#	modified:   Rakefile
#	modified:   TODO
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

If I ran git commit -a from here, all of the files would be added into the new commit. However, I want to temporarily ignore the changes in one of the files:
```bash
$ git update-index --assume-unchanged README.textile   
$ git status
# On branch master
#
# Changed but not updated:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#
#	modified:   Rakefile
#	modified:   TODO
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```
So if we commit the work now then turn the flag off, we can see that Git didn’t lose the original changes to the README. From there, you could now add them into a new commit, or revert back to the latest copy.

```bash
$ git update-index --no-assume-unchanged README.textile
$ git status
# On branch master
# Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 4 commits.
#
# Changed but not updated:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#
#	modified:   README.textile
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

## Clone a single branch

```bash
git clone -b <branchname> --single-branch <remote-repo-url> <foldername>
```

Then, if the repo was updated, to update your local copy do
```bash
git pull
```

Special case: The branch is generated by an github automation. This does not only only commit changes, but create a new branch with every build. Therefore `git pull` won't work. You have to:
```bash
git pull --rebase
```
