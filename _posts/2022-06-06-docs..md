## Install Dependencies
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev git
```
To avoid installing RubyGems packages as the root user
```bash
echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
Install Jekyll `bundler`
```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
```
## Creating a site based on Chirpy Starter
Visit https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy#quick-start

After creating a site based on the template, clone your repo
```bash
git clone git@<YOUR-USER-NAME>/<YOUR-REPO-NAME>.git
```
then install your dependencies
```bash
cd repo-name
bundle
```
After making changes to your site, commit and push then up to git
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "made some changes"
git push
```
## Jekyll Commands
serving your site
```bash
bundle exec jekyll s
```
Building your site in production mode
```bash
JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll b
```
This will output the production site to `_site`
## Building Site in CI
This site already works with GitHub actions, just push it up and check the actions Tab.,

For GitLab you can see the [pipeline I built for my own docs site here](https://github.com/techno-tim/techno-tim.github.io/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml#L18)
## Host the site locally - Building with Docker
Create a `Dockerfile` with the following
```dockerfile
FROM nginx:stable-alpine
COPY _site /usr/share/nginx/html
```
Build site in production mode
```bash
JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll b
```
Then build your image:
```bash
docker build -t docs .
```
### Or if you want to separate repo from site, just clone the repository page branch:
```bash
git clone -b gh-pages --single-branch https://github.com/agrestic1/agrestic1.github.io.git agrestic1_site
```
Create a `dockerfile`
```bash
nano ~/dockerfile
```
content
```dockerfile
FROM nginx:stable-alpine
COPY agrestic1_site /usr/share/nginx/html
```
build and run a nginx webserver with that content
```bash
docker build -t docs .
docker run -d --name docs -p 80:80 docs
```
## Creating a Post
### Naming Conventions
Jekyll uses a naming [convention for pages and posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/)

Create a file in `_posts` with the format

YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md

For example:

2022-05-23-homelab-docs.md

2022-05-34-hardware-specs.md
### Local Linking of Files

### Markdown Examples
If you need some help with markdown, check out the [markdown cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

I have lots of examples in [my documentation site repo](https://github.com/techno-tim/techno-tim.github.io/tree/master/_posts).
